# [CherryRecorder Server Environment Variables Template]
#
# This file serves as a template for the required environment variables.
# Do NOT store sensitive information in this file. It should be committed to version control.
#
# --- Instructions ---
# 1. For local Windows development (using local_build_and_run.bat):
#    - Copy this file to '.env.debug'.
#    - Fill in the variables below.
#    - The HISTORY_DIR variable can be removed or left commented out for local builds,
#      as the server will safely default to a 'history' subfolder in its execution directory.
#
# 2. For Docker development (using docker_manager.py):
#    - Copy this file to '.env.docker'.
#    - Fill in the variables below.
#    - It is CRITICAL that HISTORY_DIR is set to '/history' to match the path in the Dockerfile.
#

# --- Required Variables ---

# Google Maps API Key for server-side services (e.g., Places API).
# This key needs appropriate permissions in your Google Cloud project.
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here


# --- Docker-specific Variables ---

# Path inside the Docker container to store chat message history.
# For Docker, this should be set to '/history'.
# For local builds, you can comment this out or remove it.
HISTORY_DIR=/history
